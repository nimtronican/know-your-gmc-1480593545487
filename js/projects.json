How can these be optimized? Can there be any best practice sharing between IMTs?",

There was no existing project on digital analysis which could be used as a guidance. Although we were familiar with the jargons used in Digital Analysis, yet their usage was not very clear.

We utilized FY 2015 GTS WASO reports for the analysis. The various metrics were analyzed, sliced and diced, with focus on Paid, Owned and Earned digital tactics. In addition, we also assessed IMTs and Service Lines web pages for optimization or auditing.",
